# Walker-2D

## Task
Goal of this project was to teach the humanoid model to walk using reinforcement learning algorithms.

Environment taken from https://gym.openai.com/envs/Walker2d-v2/ and from https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym

## Solution 
Two algorithms were implemented and tested using neural networks with Tensorflow:
1. SAC
2. DDPG

## Installation needs
1. Git
2. Python 3
3. python3-venv
4. Tensorflow
5. Tensorboard
6. pip

## Installation
1. Run `install.sh`

## Documentation in Polish
1. Walker-2D.pdf
